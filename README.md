# Plant Light Sensor

This plant light sensor uses a photo transistor to give you a rough estimate of how much light your indoor plants are receiving.

## Background
There are four different types of light requirements for plants;
- Direct Light
    - West or South facing windows
    - Most intense light an indoor space can receive
- Bright Indirect Light
    - Not direct, but steady and bright
    - Light bounces off another surface before hitting plant
- Medium Light
    - Half the distance between a window and a back wall
    - Steady light from windows, but not direct
- Low Light
    - Seven or more feet from windows
    - Places that receive no natural light
    
... in Lux
- Direct Light
    - 2,000 - 4,000 lux (40% of the midday sun)
    - 4,000 - 5,000 lux (50%)
    - > 5,000 lux (but < 10,000 lux, which is the full sun outdoors)
- Bright Indirect Light
    - 1,000 - 2,000 lux
- Medium Light
    - 500 - 1,000 lux
- Low Light
    - 200-500 lux
